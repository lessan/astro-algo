= Astronomical Algorithms

This library implements algorithms from Jean Meeus, <i>Astronomical Algorithms</i>,
2nd English Edition, Willmann-Bell, Inc., Richmond, Virginia, 1999, with corrections
as of June 15, 2005.

Gem astro-algo provides two modules:

* Astro which implements algorithms from the book. (require 'astro-algo')
* LunarYear which implements helper routines for calculating lunar years. (require 'lunaryear')
 
This gem also comes with several command line scripts.
equinox::       prints the date and time of the vernal equinox for the given year.
lunarcalendar:: prints a conversion chart between the customary Gregarian
                calendar and a lunar year beginning with the full moon on or before
                the vernal equinox.
moon_clock.rb:: a Tk GUI application which displays information about the current
                lunation.
moons::         prints the phases of the moon for the given year.

This is a work in progress. Only the algorithms from <i>Astronomical Algorithms</i>
needed to support my hobby in the LunarYear have been implemented. I will add more
algorithms from the book in time.
